# üéµ Simple Noise Filter - README

## What This Does
‚Ä¢ **Listens to your environment** through your microphone
‚Ä¢ **Identifies noise types** like traffic, conversation, construction, or quiet
‚Ä¢ **Recommends soundscapes** to help mask the noise
‚Ä¢ **Plays relaxing sounds** (rain, ocean, forest, caf√©, white noise) on a timer
‚Ä¢ **Automatically stops** when the timer runs out

## How It Works
‚Ä¢ **Audio Analysis**: Uses frequency analysis to identify different types of environmental noise
‚Ä¢ **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes low, mid, and high frequency patterns to classify sounds
‚Ä¢ **Confidence Rating**: Shows how certain the system is about the noise type detected
‚Ä¢ **Sound Recommendations**: Suggests the best soundscape based on the type of noise detected

## What You Need
‚Ä¢ **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
‚Ä¢ **Microphone access** (the browser will ask for permission)
‚Ä¢ **HTTPS website** (microphone only works on secure sites)
‚Ä¢ **Your MP3 files** in a folder called `sounds/`

## File Setup
Create a folder called `sounds/` and put these MP3 files in it:
‚Ä¢ `rain.mp3` - Rain sounds
‚Ä¢ `ocean.mp3` - Ocean waves
‚Ä¢ `forest.mp3` - Forest/nature sounds
‚Ä¢ `cafe.mp3` - Caf√© ambiance
‚Ä¢ `white-noise.mp3` - White noise

## How to Use
1. **Click "Start Analyzing"** - Allow microphone access when asked
2. **Watch the detection** - See what type of noise is detected with confidence level
3. **Check recommendations** - See which soundscape is suggested for your environment
4. **Choose a sound** - Click any of the 5 sound buttons to start playing
5. **Set timer** - Use +/- buttons to adjust how long sounds play (default: 1 hour)
6. **Relax** - Sounds loop automatically and stop when timer ends

## Noise Types Detected
‚Ä¢ **Quiet** - Very low background noise
‚Ä¢ **Traffic** - Low rumbling sounds from vehicles
‚Ä¢ **Conversation** - Human speech and talking
‚Ä¢ **Construction** - Loud, irregular building/repair noises
‚Ä¢ **General** - Mixed or unidentified environmental sounds

## Sound Recommendations
‚Ä¢ **Traffic noise** ‚Üí Ocean or White Noise (masks low frequencies)
‚Ä¢ **Conversation** ‚Üí White Noise or Caf√© (masks speech)
‚Ä¢ **Construction** ‚Üí Rain or Forest (masks sharp sounds)
‚Ä¢ **Quiet environment** ‚Üí Any sound for focus/relaxation

## Timer Controls
‚Ä¢ **Default**: 60 minutes
‚Ä¢ **Adjust**: -15min, -5min, +5min, +15min buttons
‚Ä¢ **Reset**: Returns to 60 minutes
‚Ä¢ **Auto-stop**: Sounds automatically stop when timer reaches zero

## Technical Notes
‚Ä¢ **Frequency Analysis**: Examines audio spectrum from 0Hz to ~20kHz
‚Ä¢ **Real-time Processing**: Updates noise detection several times per second
‚Ä¢ **Browser-based**: No data sent to external servers - everything runs locally

## Troubleshooting
‚Ä¢ **Button turns red but doesn't work**: Make sure you're on HTTPS and allow microphone access
‚Ä¢ **No sound plays**: Check that MP3 files are in the `sounds/` folder with correct names
‚Ä¢ **Detection not working**: Ensure microphone isn't muted and has permission
‚Ä¢ **Timer not starting**: Click a sound button first, then timer begins

## Privacy
‚Ä¢ **No recording**: Audio is analyzed in real-time, never stored
‚Ä¢ **No internet required**: All processing happens in your browser
‚Ä¢ **No data collection**: Nothing is sent to external servers

## Browser Compatibility
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Chrome** (recommended)
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ **Firefox**
